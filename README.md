# CreditCardFraudDetection-Python
This project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using Python. It employs Logistic Regression for classification and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Dimensionality Reduction: Use PCA to reduce the number of features and improve model performance.
Model Training: Implement Logistic Regression to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Dependencies
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
